<h1>SimpleX Chat v2.1 - better conversation privacy</h1>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> May 24, 2022</p>
<h2>New in version 2.1 - clearing conversations without deleting contacts</h2>
<p>In this version you can irreversibly delete individual messages after they were deleted by a sender, and also completely clear the conversation.</p>
<p>The only way to do it before this version was by deleting the contact, now you can keep the connection when you clear the conversation.</p>
