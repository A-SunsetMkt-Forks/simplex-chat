    <h1>Simplex chat</h1>

<p>I'd really appreciate your feedback, criticism and suggestions on the open-source idea I was slowly working on since early 2020. I recently made the demo server for the low-level message queue protocol (&quot;simplex messaging protocol&quot;) and the website to try to explain the chat idea that would use this protocol.</p>
<p>Haskell protocol implementation: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq</p>
<p>In short, the protocol defines a minimalist set of commands and server responses (just 7 commands and 5 responses sent over TCP) to operate encrypted message queues with in-memory persistence - the implementation uses STM.</p>
<p>If anything, it was definitely helping to get to know Haskell types etc. much deeper than before :)</p>
<p>Any criticism would be great - thank you in advance!</p>
