    <h2>Announcing SimpleX Chat Prototype!</h2>
<p><strong>Published:</strong> May 12, 2021</p>
<p>For the last six months <a href="https://github.com/epoberezkin">me</a> and my son <a href="https://github.com/efim-poberezkin">Efim</a> have been working to bring you a working prototype of SimpleX Chat. We're excited to announce SimpleX Chat terminal client is now available <a href="https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat">here</a> on Linux, Windows and Mac (you can either build from source or download the binary for Linux, Windows or Mac from the latest release).</p>
<p>We’ve been using the terminal client between us and a few other people for a couple of months now, eating our own “dog food”, and have developed up to version 0.3.1, with most of the messaging protocol features we originally planned</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>End-to-end encryption with protection from man in the middle attack. The connection invitation must be passed out-of-band (see <a href="https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#how-to-use-simplex-chat">how to use SimpleX Chat</a> in the repo).</li>
<li>No global identity or any usernames visible to the server(s), ensuring full privacy of your contacts and conversations.</li>
<li>Message signing and verification with automatically generated RSA keys, with keys being unique per each connection.</li>
<li>Authorization of each command/message by the servers with automatically generated RSA key pairs, also unique per connection.</li>
<li>Message integrity validation (via passing the digests of the previous messages).</li>
<li>Encrypted TCP transport, independent of certificates.</li>
<li>You can deploy your own server, but you don’t have to - the demo SMP server to relay your messages is available at smp1.simplex.im:5223 (pre-configured in the client).</li>
</ul>
<h3>We need your help!</h3>
<p>We're building a new kind of chat network - the only network that lets you control your chat. We'd really appreciate your feedback, criticism and support - a star on the github repo, signing up to the mailing list or any contribution to the project will help. There is so much more to do!</p>
